## How to get ready?  
### Get ready for GNN  
[GNN Tutorials summary](https://medium.com/@jim.morris.shen/graph-neural-networks-5df67d78f262?source=friends_link&sk=7158f6cc1ba9931a5e2b4d1f81447ed0)

### Get ready to use DGL and Pytorch  
Please read the official document of DGL and Pytorch. 
For advanced knowledge about how to use Pytorch, please read this article.

## Papers we used for this project  
This project is mainly based on three papers:
- [Variational Graph Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07308)
- [GIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826)

## Project structure  
We have TWO PARTS:
1. Unsupervised machine learning part.
2. Supervised machine learning part. '
For the first part, we have two branches, one is used to predict the adjanct matrix as the VGAE paper. One is used to predict the Fingerprint.
So, in total, we have three branches as shown in the [network architecture]().
